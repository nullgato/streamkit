# SwiftKit

**A multi-view app to help manage streaming related tasks and applications**

*This application is unfinished, all values are hardcoded, and does not yet feature easily accessible configuration to customize the streaming data*

## Features

- **AppKit**: Application status and management to help keep your important apps together and easily accessible
- **HelperKit**: A variety of buttons to help with YouTube/Twitch/Streamlabs related tasks
- **ManagerKit**: The stream configuration for YouTube/Twitch and how you set the title and related info
- **ChatKit**: The chatting view with a YouTube/Twitch horizontal split followed by a Streamlabs vertical split underneath

## Project Roadmap(?)

This project and it's planned features/tasks are managed using a kanban board I've configured on Notion:
